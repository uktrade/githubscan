        Why We need this info?
        -----------------------
        We need to know which repositories alerts needs to be distributed to
        which team, that is the relation that this method builds

        Assumption:
        ------------
        While associating teams and repositories we assume Teams with one or
        more of following permissions are considered

         - ADMIN
         - MAINTAINER
         - WRITE

        The reasoning behind this is if team is only having 'READ' permission.
        They are not going to be able to contibute ( likely not interested either )
        anything which could fix the vulnerability

        Parameters:
        ------------
        team : name of the team for which we are going to run query
        index : index at which we need to update info
        payload: dict, { query: "valid github graphQL query", "variables": dict }

        Ideal Soltuion:
        ----------------
        Ideal solution is to have 'repositoryTeamConnection' so we can fetch
        associated teams directly from repositories query. However. there is
        not such a connection in github api v4,so we need to go other way
        around

        Optimization:
        -------------
        For optimum use of GraphQL Query we have does following
            - Sort by permission in decending order
            i.e. ADMIN , MAINTAINER,WRITE and READ
        Sorting allows us to exit loop as soon as we hit the first 'READ' permission
        knowing all following permission are 'READ'
